## Respoitory Configuration
First you will need a repository configuration for the backup. The repository configuration is the base for the backup process. The repository configuration contains the backup source and the backup target. The backup source is the path to the folder or file which should be backuped. The backup target is the path to the repository where the backup data should be restored.<br>
<br>Settings -> Extensions -> Backup Repositories -> Add Repository<br>for to create a new repository configuration.

```shell
bin/console muckiware:backup:restore 019403b49bed7109a1e238139fb759c5 8888ec40
```
Or you can choose the snapshot id from the list of snapshots in the administration panel.
- Settings -> Extensions -> Backup Repositories
- Select the backup repository
- Click on the Snapshots-tab
- And select in die list of snapshots the snapshot id for to restore the data.
  ![select_snapshot_for_restore.png](img%2Fselect_snapshot_for_restore.png)
This action will start the restore process of the backup data as a background process.

But if the shop instance is not running anymore, you can use the native restic commands for to restore the backup data.
```shell
restic -r /srv/restic-repo restore 79766175 --target /tmp/restore-workdir 
```
